        <h2> Pitch</h2>
        <p>
          "Aftershock Survivor" is a survival-based simulation game where players navigate the aftermath of a devastating earthquake. Your mission is to keep your character alive by managing resources, finding shelter, and making critical decisions. Players will love the realism, dynamic weather system, and emotional storytelling that keep them hooked and challenged.

        <h2>Theme: Peace Formers</h2>
        <p>
          This game connects to the "Peace Formers" theme by encouraging empathy and resilience in the face of natural disasters. It highlights how communities can unite, rebuild, and support one another through crisis, promoting peace through awareness and action.

        <h2>My Why</h2>
        <p>
          I created this game to explore the emotional and practical challenges of disaster survival. I want players to gain a better understanding of what survivors go through and inspire conversations about preparedness, mental health, and community support. I hope it leaves an impact and makes players more aware of the real-world effects of natural disasters.
